Objective:
This project was a proof-of-concept program where I wanted to understand socket programming and also get some GUI practice in. The source files are located in "Vendor Management src" and a runnable version can be found in "Vendor Management release". From there "Startup.bat" should be runned. This will launch the server AND client on your computer. Unfortunately omments on source files were not used.

Functions:
    - Create a new record of a new vendor consisting of information related to the vendor
    - Edit existing information
    - Search for vendor information
    - All functions are present on the server and recieves request by the Client

Notes:
- In this program claims to be "Tampa Family Clinic Vendor". This was only a name I adopted from my fathers employer and this program has never been used by them. Only was used to give me a make-believe client to build the program.

- This was also my 2nd GUI application ever.

Date:
circa. January 2020.

This project was created around 2020 and will not be updated.

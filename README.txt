This project was a proof-of-concept program where I wanted to understand socket programming and also get some GUI practice in. The source files are located in "Vendor Management src" and a runnable
version can be found in "Vendor Management release". From there "Startup.bat" should be runned. This will launch the server AND client on your computer.

This project was created around 2020 and will not be updated.

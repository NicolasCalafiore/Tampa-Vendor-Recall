# Vendor Recall
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
This was a program I made for practice with Java Server Sockets in 2018. I created a model program that contains a client and a socket server of which stored the information of vendors and could be read and edited by the client that is connected. 

#### Created: Mid 2018

## About Version One
 - Created Around Mid 2018
 - Java
 - Swing (GUI)
 - Java Sever and Client applications are available in the release.
 - A runnable version can be found in "Vendor Management release". From there "Startup.bat" should be runned to run both Client and Server
 - I used a personal company that I knew of to center my application around to give my application reasonable requirements but in no way had any affiliation with them.
 - My first socket program using Java.
